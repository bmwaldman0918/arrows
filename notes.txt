Voter stuff
altered type doesn't work with voter type, would need whole new type system for altered-voters
then that doesn't play nice with IIA

me complaining that the proofs are bad:
1 -- sen: extremely imprecise definition of decisive 

check popl for references

a coalition is strictly decisive if we can alter only the coalition and get a proof that the result prefers x to y
formalize as a list of alterations
strictly decisiveness is a product of a coalition, list of coalition agrees products (that are not actually real but can be used to prove swfa>b and then swfa>b)
we put the products in the list if we can use them to get to swfa>b BUT THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE REAL
